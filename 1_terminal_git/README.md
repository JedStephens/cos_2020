### Task 3 (Windows Users Only): Download Putty (Optional)

* We will be learning how to interact with computers through a "terminal". Windows users should navigate to http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html, and download the "putty.exe" program found on that page
* Under "Host Name", type athena.dialup.mit.edu, and click "Open"
* When prompted, type in your MIT id username and password.
* Verify you see the text "Welcome to athena.dialup.mit.edu".

### Task 4 (Windows Users Only): Download win-sshfs (Optional)

* Windows users will be utilizing the MIT athena clusters for some of the class material. win-sshfs lets Windows users access files on the MIT athena clusters from their own computers. To download, go to https://code.google.com/p/win-sshfs/downloads/list, and download the "win-sshfs-0.0.1.5-setup.exe" file. Go through the installation steps.
* After going through the installation steps, verify that you can "mount the athena as a local drive". To do this, click the "+ Add" button.
** Next to "Drive Name: ", type: <your mit id>@'athena.dialup.mit.edu'
   where <your mit id> is replaced by your MIT log-in id.
** Next to "Host: ", type: athena.dialup.mit.edu
** Next to "Port: ", leave the default number.
** Next to "Username: ", type: <your mit id>
** Next to "Authentication method", select "Password"
** Next to "Password", type your MIT log-in password.
* Click "Save", and then click "Mount". Open Windows Exporer, and verify that there is a new folder called <your mit id>@'athena.dialup.mit.edu'. Click on it, and there will be some folders in it.

## Task 5: Begin considering project team and data set

* There will be a sustained project over the first half of the seminar which will be done in teams and presented in Session 5.
* Begin planning your team and the data set you will work with. Both decisions will be a part of the pre-assignment for Session 2.
