# Overview

This session is on modeling and machine learning in R.  We will focus on the relevant steps of the machine learning pipeline, which are mainly:

1. Model selection
2. Model evaluation

The session will be structured around building supervised learning models (including linear regression, LASSO, logistic regression, and CART) on the Boston Airbnb data set. We will also touch on unsupervised learning, with a section that introduces k-means clustering.  


# Before the Session

## Project Preparation

...

## Technical Preparation

First, `git pull` to ensure that you have the most up-to-date versions of all of the files for this session. The pre-lecture assignment for this session is **pre_lecture_assignment.R**.  Please open the file, install the relevant R packages, and double-check that you obtain the same output as in the **output-*.png** screenshots.

Then, **upload screenshots of your matching R console to Stellar**.

If you have any questions about installing the required software, feel free to contact Sam (`sgilmour@mit.edu`) or Elisabeth (`epaulson@mit.edu`).
